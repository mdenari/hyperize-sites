  name: ZPT Publisher CLI Decision Workflow
  description: Orchestrates a discussion between Analyst and CTO to define the ZPT Publisher CLI project (name, responsibilities, scope, tech stack, and security approach).
  team: ZPT Publisher Team
  objective: |-
    Define the project details for the ZPT Publisher CLI:
    1. What is the best name for this automation tool/hub?
    2. Who (which specialized agent) should be responsible for implementing the Python script (file manipulation, asset discovery, Git commands)?
    3. Who should handle the Vercel/Git integration architecture and the middleware for security?
    4. Confirm the overall project scope: Create a CLI in the 'Sites' folder to publish HTML presentations from other folders, generating a menu (index.html), and handling basic security (password protection via Vercel Edge Middleware).

  steps:
    - name: Analyze Project Requirements
      agent: analyst
      instruction: |-
        Review the user's request for the presentation automation project. 
        Identify the core functional requirements, potential challenges, and propose a concise name for the tool. 
        Consider the existing project structure and the need for a simplified publishing process.

    - name: Define Technical Architecture and Responsibilities
      agent: cto
      instruction: |-
        Based on the Analyst's findings and the overall project objective, define the technical architecture for the ZPT Publisher CLI.
        This includes the technology stack (Python, JavaScript for middleware, HTML for menu).
        Clearly assign responsibilities for the Python script implementation, the Vercel/Git integration, and the middleware development to specific agents.
        Confirm the project scope as understood.
        Provide a conclusive decision on the project name.

    - name: Final Decision Consolidation
      agent: analyst
      instruction: |-
        Consolidate the architecture and responsibilities defined by the CTO and the requirements and naming proposed by the Analyst.
        Summarize the final project plan, including the agreed-upon name, agent assignments, and confirmed scope.
        Present this as the definitive outcome of the workflow.
