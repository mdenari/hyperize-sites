## Quick Start

### For New Projects

1. Review `hyperize-stack.md` for baseline architecture
2. Check `project-patterns.md` for proven solutions
3. Avoid patterns in `anti-patterns.md`

### For Troubleshooting

1. Check `troubleshooting/` for known issues
2. Review similar incidents in `../sessions/`

## Contributing

As Max learns:

- Document successful patterns → `project-patterns.md`
- Document failures → `anti-patterns.md`
- Add integration guides → `integrations/`
- Record troubleshooting → `troubleshooting/`
